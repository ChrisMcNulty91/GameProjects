This project is not fully complete. a more complete version will be uploaded once I have ported the code
over to the libGDX library. This code as is can serve as an example for those looking to start with the 
Slick2D library. For those of you who wish to download and run the code you will need to download the 
Slick2D/Lwjgl Libraries and go through the initial linking process
