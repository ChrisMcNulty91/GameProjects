																									Pong-libGDX

Aim of the game
-------------------

The aim of the game is to try and score 9 goals before your opponent.
The opponent is ai controlled(extreamly simple ai).
The controls are as follows

PC Controlls
-------------------

W - Moves up
S - Moves down

Android Controlls
------------------

Touch Top portions of the screen to move up
Touch bottom portions of the screen to move down


Notes
---------------------------

Due to the simplicity of the ai/the lack of variety in the balls direction after a hit it is impossible to win
I just created this project to test out the libGDX framework before moving onto bigger projects
